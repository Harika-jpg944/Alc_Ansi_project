#shell module runs commands via shell, by default /bin/sh. It supports pipe, redirects. We usually use shell module for commands needing shell features. Running command using shell modules, there might be a risk of shell injection
#command module does not run via shell. No support of pipes, redirects and can be used to execute simple command. There is no risk of shell injection.
#For example, if you want to run echo $HOME, you must use shell module and command module wont work.
#Please note that it is important you are aware of the differences between command and shell module.
